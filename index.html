          <h2>Software Developer</h2>
  
          <p>Nice to meet you, my name is Diogo, I'm 18 years old and I finished my high school in 2022. With my Technical Computer Course at FIEC completed, I have experience with Java (together with Spring Boot), Visual Basic, ASP. NET, Python, Node.js, Next.js, ReactJs, MySQL, SQLServer and of course, in presentations and teamwork.
            Finally, I have my English too, today I'm almost fluent, I started in 2018 and graduated in 2019 at Yázigi.</p>
          <p>I also have completed my Technical Education in Computer Science at FIEC and I am now at a college graduating myself in Computer Science, in addition to other professional courses to improve my knowledge.</p>
